			<span class="title project white">OUNCE</span>
			<span class="project-margin body2">OUNCE is a food tracking application designed for individuals who keep records of their cats' diets. Previously, people either manually recorded information or typed it out in various note-taking apps, which often proved inconvenient. To address this issue, we conducted research on common practices and preferences among pet owners, enabling us to create a user-friendly system for recording and easily accessing essential information. This application allows users to record specific details, which are used to classify and filter the food's quality.  To promote this, we opened a website and Instagram.

					Through data analysis, surveys, and interviews, we gained insights into people's concerns, as well as their criteria for selecting and recording pet food choices. According to the research, the most crucial factor when choosing pet food is their 'pet's preference.' This is particularly challenging to fulfill, hence emphasizing the importance of keeping records. The difficulties encountered in recording pet food choices include the following:

						Based on planning and research, we proceeded with app design. Reflecting the preferences of the target audience, women aged 20 to 30, we chose a cute cat character as the main design. The concept revolves around the 'journey to discover tastes,' and as records accumulate, the cat on the main screen embarks on new adventures. Users can rate their pets' preferences, leave tags and notes related to pet food, and keep track of their records. The recorded information can be filtered based on preference and submission order.
						<br>The application has been released for both iOS and Android platforms.
